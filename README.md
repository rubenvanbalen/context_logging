## Context
Software always runs fine until it doesn't. Often, failing software leaves people clueless, unable to explain what exactly happened. For serious problems, a lot of effort is spent to recreate and replay the scenario in a non-production setting, trying to make sense of the context in which the problem was triggered. This makes these failures very expensive.

Software has its pitfalls even without failing. Answering queries from within the organization easily becomes complex without the proper information and context. This Python module tries to solve these problems by making it easy to add context to your logging. With supplementary in-memory logging where specific logs are written only depending on the state of a context, resulting in smaller log files containing all necessary information in your desired environment.
